# 🏦 Centryx – AI-Powered Centralized Financial Management Platform**
## 🧩 Problem Statement
In today’s digital era, individuals and small businesses often manage multiple bank accounts, e-wallets, and investment platforms without a unified view of their financial health.
This fragmentation causes:

**⚠️ Poor cash flow visibility**

**⚠️ Inefficient budgeting**

**⚠️ Uninformed financial decisions**

Most existing financial apps focus on either expense tracking or investment management, but none provide an integrated, AI-assisted solution that unifies real-time transactions and simplifies accounting.

## 💡Solution
Therefore, there is a critical need for a centralized financial management platform that offers:

**✅ A complete cash flow overview**
**✅ Integrated transaction capabilities**
**✅ A modern, user-friendly interface for smooth financial navigation**

### 🌟 Core Value Proposition
